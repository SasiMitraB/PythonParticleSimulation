class Ball:
    """
    Class representing a ball in a 2D space.

    Attributes:
    - pos (numpy.ndarray): The position of the ball as a 2D numpy array [x, y].
    - vel (numpy.ndarray): The velocity of the ball as a 2D numpy array [vx, vy].
    - acc (numpy.ndarray): The acceleration of the ball as a 2D numpy array [ax, ay].

    Methods:
    - __init__(self, position, velocity, acceleration): Constructor to initialize the ball with
      a given position, velocity, and acceleration.
    - collide(self): Method to handle collisions with the walls and update the velocity accordingly.
    - update(self): Method to update the position, velocity, and handle collisions.

    Usage:
    1. Create an instance of the Ball class with initial position, velocity, and acceleration.
    2. Call the update method to simulate the motion of the ball, considering collisions.
    3. Access the attributes 'pos' and 'vel' to retrieve the current position and velocity.

    Note: This class assumes a 2D space, and collisions with the walls are handled by
          reversing the appropriate component of the velocity.

    """
    Handle collision between two objects.

    Parameters:
    - pos1 (numpy.ndarray): Position of the first object.
    - pos2 (numpy.ndarray): Position of the second object.
    - vel1 (numpy.ndarray): Velocity of the first object.
    - vel2 (numpy.ndarray): Velocity of the second object.
    - r1 (float): Radius of the first object.
    - r2 (float): Radius of the second object.

    Returns:
    - numpy.ndarray: Updated velocity of the first object.
    - numpy.ndarray: Updated velocity of the second object.

    Collision Formula:
    - Calculate the distance between the two objects manually using Euclidean norm:
      r = np.sqrt(np.sum((pos1 - pos2)**2))

    - Check if a collision occurs (distance is less than or equal to COLLISION_DISTANCE):
      if r <= COLLISION_DISTANCE:
        - Update velocities using collision formula:
        vel1_new = vel1 - 2 * (np.sum((vel1 - vel2) * (pos1 - pos2)) / np.sum((pos1 - pos2)**2)) * (pos1 - pos2) * (r2**2 / (r1**2 + r2**2))

    The collision formula updates the velocities of two objects after a collision
    based on the conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy.
